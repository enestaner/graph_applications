## **SOME GRAPH APPLICATIONS**

- Creating random graphs
- Counting **number** of components which given graph
- Specify a given graph with degree sequence is *Graphic* or *Not Graphic*
- Finding Prufer code from given *labeled tree* and **vice versa**
- Finding *minimum spanning tree* in given graph with **Kruskal Algorithm**
